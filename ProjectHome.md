This project aims to be a very thin layer which allows a developer to map data from one class into another.  For example where a Struts 2 bean is used in the web tier and a plain DTO is used in the business tier - these may not be the same shape.  The purpose of this layer is to provide a very performant and easy to configure mechanism for moving this data; without the need for repetitive get/set code!
